# no-show-for-appointments
answering the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment

**Questions for Analysis:**


in this report we posed two questions related to the probability that a patient will show up for his appointment or he will just miss it
1. are these patients taking many appointments less likely to miss their appointments?
2. which waiting period is equivalent to less frequent appointment missing (not showing up for an appointment?


**Conclusions**



if we are to guess which group of patients are less likely to miss their appointments we can comfortably guess that patients who are taking appointments frequently specially more than 30 appointments annually are not going to miss their appointment
if we are to guess which patients are to miss their appointments we can look at the waiting time we will see that patients waiting more than 15 days to take their appointment after they had resigerated for it are more likely to miss their apppointments than others



**Limitations**



this results are only considered for patients with in this dataset we cant use it to predict the behaveiour of any new patient resigerating for an appointment as no tests were preformed to decide whether this data is a good indicator for the entire population distribution

future work can be done to decide if more frequent resigerating patients got a long waiting time period are they less likely to miss their appointments as patients with long waiting period (typically between 10 and 15 days) have the best records within missing no appointments
