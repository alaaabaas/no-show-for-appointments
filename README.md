# no-show-for-appointments
answering the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment

Questions for Analysis:
in this report we posed two questions related to the probability that a patient will show up for his appointment or he will just miss it
1. are these patients taking many appointments less likely to miss their appointments?
2. which waiting period is equivalent to less frequent appointment missing (not showing up for an appointment?
